DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	In these 3 cases, <e1>suicide</e1> followed abrupt discontinuation of <e2>clozapine</e2> or transition to another antipsychotic.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	In this case report, we describe a man who developed recurrent depression and suicidal ideation with a serious plan to commit <e1>suicide</e1> as definite adverse effect of <e2>ciprofloxacin</e2>, which had been prescribed for recurrent prostatitis.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	We report a case demonstrating an instance of <e1>eszopiclone</e1>-induced parasomnia involving paranoia and a <e2>suicide attempt</e2> in a patient taking eszopiclone.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	The concern that antidepressant (AD) drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and <e1>paroxetine</e1> (PAR) in particular, can increase <e2>suicidality</e2> during the early treatment of juvenile patients (children and adolescents) has created a dilemma for clinicians treating depressives.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	<e1>Paroxetine</e1> was a significant risk factor for <e2>suicide</e2> on univariate analysis, 4.23 (1.19-14.95), but not when corrected for age, gender and depression/suicidal ideation, 2.76 (0.30-24.87).
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Psychomotor performance is not impaired by paroxetine and there is no evidence of any <e1>zimelidine</e1>-like hypersensitivity reactions or increase in <e2>suicidal ideation</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	The risk of <e1>suicide</e1> and side effects of <e2>SSRI</e2> with isotretinoin, especially in patient with psychiatric illness would be a huge concern.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	<e1>Levetiracetam</e1>-induced rage is a rare neurobehavioral adverse effect of levetiracetam that is characterized by seething rage, uncontrollable anger, fits of fury, depression, violence, and <e2>suicidal tendencies</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	There were more <e1>suicide-related adverse events</e1> in the patients treated with <e2>fluoxetine</e2> (15 of 216) than in patients not treated with fluoxetine (9 of 223).
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	<e1>Suicidal ideation</e1> was common in individuals who were single with poorer mental health, had higher depression, and had received some drug or alcohol treatment in the past 3 months or had used cocaine or <e2>marijuana</e2> in the past 30 days.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Bipolar disorder, inhalant use disorders, <e1>cocaine</e1> use disorders, and hallucinogen use disorders were found to be predictive of <e2>attempted suicide</e2>, after adjusting for all other covariates.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Two episodes of attempted suicide and one episode of <e1>completed suicide</e1> occurred in <e2>duloxetine</e2> recipients during the 24-week open-label phase of a longer-term trial.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Our study identified a signal for the association hydroxychloroquineâ+â<e1>metformin</e1> that appears to be more at risk of fatal outcomes (particularly by <e2>completed suicides</e2>) than one of the two drugs when given alone.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	The potential mechanisms of this syndrome will be discussed; (3) Hospitalized cocaine users who present with headaches most frequently have depression with <e1>suicidal ideation</e1>, often associated with <e2>cocaine</e2> withdrawal; and (4) Structural brain disease in these patients may result from a variety of causes.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	In view of the potential, if unproven, risk that varenicline may be associated with serious neuropsychiatric adverse outcomes, patients attempting to quit smoking with <e1>varenicline</e1>, and their families and caregivers, should be alerted about the need to monitor for neuropsychiatric symptoms, including changes in behaviour, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal ideation and <e2>suicidal behaviour</e2>, and to report such symptoms immediately to the patient's healthcare provider.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	In 2009, based largely on case reports, the FDA issued a warning of possible adverse neuropsychiatric effects including depression and <e1>suicidal thoughts and behavior</e1> for <e2>varenicline</e2> and bupropion.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Adverse events associated with <e1>varenicline</e1> therapy have been reported in post-marketing surveillance, including neuropsychiatric events such as depressed mood, agitation, changes in behaviour, suicidal ideation and <e2>suicide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	A number of SAEs are associated with bupropion and new warnings were recently added to <e1>bupropion</e1> prescribing information because of observed neuropsychiatric symptoms including <e2>suicidal thoughts and behaviours</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	In the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, <e1>Z-drugs</e1> were associated with <e2>suicidal ideation</e2> (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41-4.22), as was trazodone (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.45-3.75), after analyses adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and exposure to various psychotropic medications.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Although zolpidem prescription was associated with an increased risk of <e1>suicide attempts</e1> in people with depression, the risk increased and peaked immediately before <e2>zolpidem</e2> prescription.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	There was a high rate of suicide attempts among both groups (23% of those in the detoxification unit and 28% of those maintained on <e1>codeine</e1>), but treating physicians tended to underestimate <e2>suicidality</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	The US FDA has issued safety alerts and required manufacturers of leukotriene-modifying agents (LTMAs), including <e1>montelukast</e1>, zafirlukast and zileuton, to include <e2>suicide</e2> and neuropsychiatric events as a precaution in the drug label.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Our results suggest that female citalopram users with ABCB1 1236T-2677T-3435T are more vulnerable to adverse effects of the drugs as this haplotype was enriched in non-violent <e1>suicides</e1> of female <e2>citalopram</e2> users.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	The most abused substances were cigarettes (78%) and <e1>opium</e1> (42%); 6% of substance abusers had thought about suicide five times or more in the past year; 5% of substance abusers had seriously attempted <e2>suicide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Although fatal <e1>colchicine</e1> intoxications are rare and mostly related to <e2>suicidal intake</e2> or accidental overdose, other hypotheses should be considered when dealing with colchicine poisoning.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	<e1>Amitriptyline</e1> and dothiepin are often presented in subtherapeutic and ineffective doses and it is possible that increased <e2>suicides</e2> may result from inadequately treated depression.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	This paper reports on two clinical cases involving patients with a diagnosis of mood disorder who developed severe akathisia, anxiety, and <e1>suicidal ideation</e1> while using a combination of aripiprazole, antidepressants, and <e2>lamotrigine</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Secondly, this case had experienced <e1>suicide ideation</e1> after taking 20 mg of zolpidem, suggesting a possible correlation between <e2>zolpidem</e2> psychological effects and dangerous psychological behaviors.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Differential lethality indices taken from large community studies support the notion that noradrenergic drugs such as maprotiline, desipramine, and <e1>nortriptyline</e1> are associated with a higher than expected incidence of death from overdose, and the <e2>suicide-provoking potential</e2> may relate to some noradrenergic property.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	After a depressive symptomatology during the <e1>IFNalpha</e1> therapy, which had been tolerably treated by mirtazapine, he committed a <e2>suicide attempt</e2> six months after the parallel termination of IFNalpha and antidepressant treatment.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	The use of <e1>valproic acid</e1> (RR=1.53, 95% CI: 1.26-1.85, p<0.001), antidepressants (RR=1.49, 95% CI: 1.23-1.8, p<0.001) and benzodiazepines (RR=1.49, 95% CI: 1.23-1.80, p<0.001) was associated with increased risk of <e2>attempted suicide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, varenicline and the antipsychotic medicine <e1>clozapine</e1> were included in the top five medicines with the most frequent reports of <e2>fatal and non-fatal suicidal behaviour</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	<e1>Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha)</e1> is the only effective treatment for chronic hepatitis B and C. Over 2/3 of methadone-substituted patients suffer from chronic hepatitis C but a history of psychiatric disorders or drug addiction is still seen as a contraindication for IFN-alpha because of a possible increased risk of severe psychiatric side effects such as depression, <e2>suicide</e2> attempts or psychotic episodes.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Expert opinion: Whilst secukinumab and ixekizumab were not associated with increased signal of suicidal behavior, being recently approved for the treatment of psoriasis by EMA and FDA, <e1>brodalumab</e1> raised concern because of <e2>suicide behavior</e2> cases that led to pause momentarily its development program during pre-marketing stage before obtaining the positive recommendation by an FDA advisory panel for its approval.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Antidepressants other than TCAs or <e1>venlafaxine</e1> should be considered in patients at risk of seizure or <e2>suicide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	In this case report, we present a case of a 38-year-old male with a history of alcohol and tobacco use disorders and no other psychiatric history, including no history of suicidal ideationÂ or <e1>suicide</e1> attempts, who was admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility after a suicide attempt while acutely intoxicated with alcohol one week after starting <e2>varenicline</e2> treatment for smoking cessation.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Negative media reports linking <e1>SSRIs</e1> to increased child <e2>suicide rates</e2> have also resulted in a decline in the prescribing of SSRIs to this age group, but with no concomitant increase in the prescribing of fluoxetine, the only antidepressant recommended for the treatment of children.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	We conclude that <e1>antidepressants</e1> may induce <e2>suicidality</e2> in a subset of persons with depressive (and probably anxious) presentations; that this induction may represent a form of manic conversion, and hence a bipolar phenotype, and that lithium's therapeutic properties may include the ability to prevent antidepressant-induced suicidality.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Although the causal role of isotretinoin in suicidal behaviour is controversial, <e1>suicide attempts</e1> (SA) do occur among patients taking <e2>isotretinoin</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Doxepin, zaleplon, tricyclic antidepressants, <e1>zolpidem</e1>, or lorazepam were rarely prescribed due to lack of evidence and/or concerns about adverse effects, long-term safety, suitability for youth, <e2>suicidality</e2>, and dependence/tolerance.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	A total of 29,856 adverse event reports were identified among patients receiving efavirenz, atazanavir, darunavir, etravirine, nevirapine and <e1>raltegravir</e1>, of which 457 were reports of <e2>suicidality events</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Adult individuals diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, stroke, suicide, <e1>suicide</e1> attempt, fall injury, or that suffered a road traffic crash from 01.10.2006 for <e2>bupropion</e2>, or from 01.03.2008 for varenicline, until 31.12.2013 were included.
