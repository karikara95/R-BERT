DRUG_Event(e1,e2)	The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of studies attempted to reach an explanatory model of underlying pathophysiology of <e1>melatonin</e1> in thepathogenesis of seasonal variation in <e2>suicidality</e2>.
DRUG_Event(e2,e1)	These findings suggest that the increased risk of <e1>suicide</e1> in MS patients may be related to decreased 5-HT functions and blunted circadian <e2>melatonin</e2> secretion.

DRUG_Event(e2,e1)	Weekly <e1>suicide mortalities</e1> and <e2>influenza</e2>-like illness (ILI) were analyzed using time series regression.
DRUG_Event(e1,e2)	We found no evidence of short-term or long-term association between <e1>influenza</e1> death rates and <e2>suicide death rates</e2> across three 20th century pandemics.
DRUG_Event(e1,e2)	This has been attributed to causes such as <e1>influenza</e1>, austerity policies and deaths of despair (drugs, alcohol and <e2>suicide</e2>).
DRUG_Event(e2,e1)	Hospice utilization was lowest for conditions leading to rapid or unexpected death, such as accidents and <e1>suicide</e1> (0%), <e2>influenza</e2> and pneumonia (3%), and sepsis (6%).

DRUG_Event(e1,e2)	In 2010, the API-non-Hispanic black disparity was largest for heart disease, malignant neoplasms, cerebrovascular diseases, and nephritis; the API-American Indian/Alaska Native disparity was largest for unintentional injury, diabetes mellitus, <e1>influenza</e1> and pneumonia, and <e2>suicide</e2>; and the API-non-Hispanic white disparity was largest for chronic lower respiratory diseases and Alzheimer disease.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Here, we report a case of a 22-year-old male who complained of mood swings, <e1>suicidal feelings</e1>, auditory hallucinations, memory deterioration, and insomnia after taking <e2>oseltamivir</e2>.
DRUG_Event(e2,e1)	Competing risk regression showed that bipolar disorder was associated with increased hazard of death by <e1>suicide</e1>, accidents, pneumonia or <e2>influenza</e2>, and diseases of the liver and digestive system.
DRUG_Event(e1,e2)	Post-<e1>dexamethasone</e1> cortisol levels were significantly correlated with the total number of depressive symptoms and <e2>suicidal ideation</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	After adjusting for demographic variables and lifetime use of other substances: current <e1>amphetamine</e1> users and former injectors showed an increased likelihood of having medical illnesses and hospitalizations; current injectors had elevated odds of <e2>suicidal thoughts or attempts</e2>; current noninjectors exhibited elevated odds of anxiety, cognitive impairment, and violent behaviors; and former noninjectors had increased odds of depression.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Bivariate analyses indicated elevated rates of psychiatric problems (depression, anxiety, hallucinations, cognitive impairment, violence, <e1>suicidal thoughts/attempts</e1>) and medical illnesses (dermatological, hepatic, cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, seizure, allergy conditions) among <e2>amphetamine</e2> users.

DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	The emergence of <e1>suicidal ideation</e1> during treatment with <e2>fluoxetine</e2> may be secondary to the development of akathisia.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	All three patients developed severe akathisia during retreatment with <e1>fluoxetine</e1> and stated that the development of the akathisia made them feel suicidal and that it had precipitated their prior <e2>suicide attempts</e2>.

DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Dysphoria, akathisia, depressed mood with <e1>suicidal ideation</e1>, insomnia, racing thoughts, and labile affect were seen following the administration of <e2>metoclopramide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	A higher incidence of <e1>suicide</e1> or non-adherence occurred in <e2>paracetamol</e2>-related ALF (p<0.001).
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Even though, during subsequent <e1>topiramate</e1> treatment, a serious life event (<e2>suicide attempt</e2> of brother) induced re-occurence of the patient's psychopathology, which did not require hospitalization.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	On the basis of this critical appraisal, <e1>gabapentin</e1> is one drug that may increase risk of <e2>suicide attempts</e2> and completions in these patients.

DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Although it is believed that overall, <e1>fluoxetine</e1> is effective in child and adolescent psychiatry, there have been reports of specific adverse drug effects, most prominently, <e2>suicidality</e2> and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, worsening of depression, and anxiety.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Part of the reason for the predominance of psychological treatments in these guidelines is the small but significant risk of <e1>suicidality</e1> with <e2>fluoxetine</e2>.

DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	<e1>Desvenlafaxine</e1> was generally well tolerated in clinical trials; the most common adverse events were nausea, <e2>suicidal ideation</e2>, and changes in blood pressure and weight.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	In addition, several reports show that adolescent <e1>fluoxetine</e1> treatment increases risk for <e2>suicidal behavior</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	This case shows that <e1>fluoxetine</e1> can be associated with extrapyramidal symptoms, and this may have an aggravating affect on clinical depression progress and the emergence of <e2>suicidal ideation</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	<e1>Fluoxetine</e1> treatment led to greater benefit rather than risk for <e2>suicidality</e2>.

DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Unfortunately, inhibition of CB1 in the central nervous system (CNS) produces adverse effects, including depression, anxiety and <e1>suicidal ideation</e1> in some patients, which led to withdrawal of the pyrazole inverse agonist <e2>rimonabant</e2> (SR141716A) from European markets.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	We report a case of depression and <e1>suicidal ideation</e1> in coincidence with the start of increased doses of <e2>interferon beta-1a</e2> and their complete reversal following the drug withdrawal.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	The observed time sequence, with the repetition 4 weeks later of high <e1>suicidal behaviour</e1>, led us to consider that this effect might possibly be linked to the <e2>aripiprazole</e2> treatment, which could have increased the risk of suicide in this patient.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	The non-tissue selective CB1 antagonist <e1>rimonabant</e1> (2) was approved as a weight-loss agent in Europe but produced centrally mediated adverse effects in some patients including dysphoria and <e2>suicidal ideation</e2> leading to its withdrawal.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Although <e1>montelukast</e1> is considered to be a safe drug, there are concerns regarding adverse drug reactions, including the rare occurrence of Churg-Strauss syndrome and, despite insufficient data, the possibility of neuropsychiatric events such as anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and <e2>suicidality</e2>.

DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	However, the first marketed CB1R antagonist/inverse agonist <e1>rimonabant</e1> was discontinued, as its use was occasionally associated with negative affect and <e2>suicidality</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	At a mean follow-up of 13.8 months (95% CI 13.6-14.0), the trial was prematurely discontinued because of concerns by health regulatory authorities in three countries about <e1>suicide</e1> in individuals receiving <e2>rimonabant</e2>.

DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	<e1>Suicide</e1> also remained associated with a diagnosis of affective disorder (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3 to 4.2), anxiety/personality disorder (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.6), treatment with <e2>antidepressants</e2> (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.2), and treatment with opioid analgesics (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.5).
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	We found opposing trends toward a lower risk of suicide during current use of <e1>clozapine</e1> and a higher risk of <e2>suicide</e2> associated with cumulative use up to 1 year.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Because suicidal ideation and <e1>suicide attempts</e1> are more prevalent in people with substance use disorders than in the general population, and because of the lack of recommendations governing <e2>baclofen</e2> prescription in such a situation, its use needs to be better controlled.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	We describe a 54-year-old patient with familial Parkinson's disease, who after initiation of CAI in addition to high dose <e1>levodopa</e1> and amantadine, developed impulse control disorder (major financial loss related to risky transactions and self-medication), psychosis and depression, which lead up to attempted <e2>suicide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Among those with no exposure to <e1>tetrabenazine</e1> 17 <e2>suicide attempt</e2>s (1.4%) and four suicides (0.3%) occurred.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	In the first year off lithium, affective illness recurred in 67% of patients, and <e1>suicidal rates</e1> rose 20-fold but were much lower thereafter; fatalities were 14 times more frequent after discontinuation of <e2>lithium</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	After the discontinuation of lithium, <e1>suicidal acts</e1> were more frequent in the first year than at later times or before start of <e2>lithium</e2> treatment.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	One pediatric (attempted suicide) (and no adult patient events) was categorized as <e1>suicidal behavior</e1> in the <e2>atomoxetine</e2> group.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	The findings confirm that addicts are still at higher risk of <e1>suicide</e1> than the general population and that prescribed drugs, notably <e2>antidepressants</e2> and methadone, influence this heightened risk.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	In addition, <e1>atomoxetine</e1> has a boxed warning on the increased risk of <e2>suicidal ideation</e2> in children and adolescents treated with atomoxetine.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	The available evidence suggests that adolescents may experience an increase in <e1>suicidal ideation and behavior</e1> with SSRI use, particularly those who have a depressive disorder and those treated with <e2>paroxetine</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Three of the four reviews limited to children and adolescents found a significantly increased risk of <e1>suicidal ideation or behavior</e1> with SSRI use which was most evident in teenagers taking <e2>paroxetine</e2> and in teenagers with depressive disorders.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Concerns that treatment for heroin dependence using <e1>naltrexone</e1> may increase <e2>suicide rates</e2> during treatment and fatal overdoses posttreatment have been expressed.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	<e1>Methadone</e1>-maintained patients of MMT clinics have a high prevalence of suicidal ideation and therefore at high risk for <e2>suicide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	An increase in IL-6 levels at 6-month follow-up visit is associated with <e1>SSRI</e1>-emergent <e2>suicidality</e2> in high-risk children and adolescents treated with fluoxetine.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Although there have been reports of adolescents developing acute psychosis shortly after starting <e1>infliximab</e1>, this is, to our knowledge, the first report of adolescent <e2>suicidal behavior</e2> in the setting of infliximab treatment.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	The hallucinogenic effects caused by <e1>ketamine</e1>, associated with an increased sensitivity of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors to ketamine as result of the previous history of alcoholism should be considered as potential inducing factors in <e2>suicide behaviors</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	A case series outlining three young individuals with no history of mental disorder who were treated for skin conditions with <e1>doxycycline</e1>, but developed suicidal ideation with an outcome of <e2>suicide</e2> in two of the cases.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	We report a case where a patient was inadvertently given a second loading dose of Degarelix that resulted in acute psychosis in the form of panic attacks, delusions, <e1>suicidal thoughts</e1>, insomnia and some visual hallucinations, which are not reported as side-effects of <e2>Degarelix</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Although no causal link between <e1>isotretinoin</e1> and psychiatric adverse effects has been established, widespread media reporting of depression and <e2>suicidality</e2> with use of isotretinoin have raised concerns in both patients and clinicians and generated numerous cases of costly litigation.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	In view of reports of treatment-related <e1>suicide-related behaviour</e1> with <e2>atomoxetine</e2>, it is recommended that adults should be observed for agitation, irritability, suicidal thinking, self-harming or unusual behaviour, particularly in the first months of treatment, or after a change of dose.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Possible side effects include depression, suicide, and <e1>suicidal ideation</e1>; however, other studies suggest <e2>isotretinoin</e2> may improve mood and quality of life.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Another female patient with a history of depression, but free of symptoms under antidepressive medication since more than 15 years, developed severe <e1>suicidal ideation</e1> 2 months after <e2>ziconotide</e2> treatment (cumulative dosage: about 2900μg) with rapid recovery after drug discontinuation.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Despite the demonstrated anti-depressant efficacy of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), increased <e1>suicidal ideation</e1> and/or agitation have been reported in a small proportion of individuals receiving fluoxetine or <e2>other SSRIs</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	In the entire cohort, fluoxetine use was associated with the lowest risk (RR, 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-0.93), and <e1>venlafaxine hydrochloride</e1> use with the highest risk (RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.01-2.57), of <e2>suicide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Tricyclic antidepressants particularly of <e1>imipramine</e1> and clomipramine can have <e2>pro-suicidal effect</e2>, which is believed to be the consequence of their own hypothetic asynchronous cognitive-psychomotor pharmacodynamic action.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Restricting the maximum quantity of caffeine tablets available over the counter seemed to be effective in preventing <e1>suicides</e1> because of <e2>caffeine</e2> although some time elapsed until the effect was noted.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Case reports of increased or new <e1>suicidal ideation</e1> following administration of fluoxetine and <e2>other SSRIs</e2>, however, raise questions about how these potential side effects may relate to the SSRI's acute effects on 5-HT transmission.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	The most recently approved agent, <e1>brodalumab</e1>, had few cases of <e2>suicidal behavior</e2>, including completed suicide, in the phase 3 clinical program leading both the US FDA and Health Canada to add a boxed warning to its label.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	<e1>Lithium</e1> was associated with a (non-significantly) lower risk of suicide attempts, and with significantly decreased <e2>suicide mortality</e2> in univariate (RR=0.39, 95% CI: 0.17-0.93, p=0.03), Cox (HR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.16-0.88, p=0.02) and marginal structural models (HR=0.31, 95% CI: 0.12-0.79, p=0.02).
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	A black-box warning for <e1>suicidal ideation</e1> has been published in the US prescribing information, based on findings from a meta-analysis showing that <e2>atomoxetine</e2> is associated with a significantly higher incidence of suicidal ideation than placebo.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	In multivariate analyses adjusting for socio-demographics and psychosocial stressors, among primary drugs of abuse, chronic [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.97] and occasional (AOR: 1.92) <e1>cocaine</e1> use, and chronic amphetamine use (AOR: 1.96) were independently associated with <e2>attempted suicide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Among people who inject drugs, use of alcohol, sedative-hypnotics and <e1>cannabis</e1>, but not cocaine, amphetamine or opioids, appears to be associated with an increased likelihood of later <e2>attempted suicide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	In line with this paradigm, phenobarbital and <e1>phenytoin</e1> seem to be the only drugs with proven <e2>suicidality</e2> risk.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	We report a case of a <e1>suicide attempt</e1> in a young adult male where ingestion of the antihistamines diphenhydramine and <e2>doxylamine</e2> was complicated by non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	<e1>Suicide attempt</e1>s in a prospective cohort of patients with schizophrenia treated with <e2>sertindole</e2> or risperidone.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Improvement in attention along with the reduction of pathologic electroencephalogram activity was observed in four patients, two with sulthiame, and one each with lamotrigine and <e1>levetiracetam</e1> (which was ceased because of <e2>suicidal tendencies</e2>).
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Herewith are reported three cases in which depression and desperation over cocaine dependence were the motivations for <e1>successful suicide</e1>, which was accomplished through the intravenous injection of <e2>cocaine</e2> to the point of death.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	<e1>Cocaine</e1> use may cause the development of psychosis, with subsequent expression of <e2>suicidal ideations</e2>, and potentially even successful suicide.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Robust denominators for community prescribing were not available for two drugs with five or more <e1>suicide</e1> reports, <e2>efavirenz</e2> (an antiretroviral medicine) and clozapine.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Using multiple reference periods, <e1>varenicline</e1> was associated with an increased risk of self-harm (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.12-1.56) and <e2>suicide</e2> (OR = 3.56, 95% CI = 1.32-9.60) but a reduction in all-cause death (OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.61-0.93).
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	The risk of <e1>suicide</e1> in persons with epilepsy may be associated with epilepsy-related factors such as a high <e2>antiepileptic drug</e2> load, frequent seizures, and use of pregabalin, independent of depression.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	In within-individual analyses, <e1>gabapentin</e1>oid treatment was associated with increased hazards of <e2>suicidal behaviour</e2> and deaths from suicide (age adjusted hazard ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 1.32), unintentional overdoses (1.24, 1.19 to 1.28), head/body injuries (1.22, 1.19 to 1.25), and road traffic incidents and offences (1.13, 1.06 to 1.20).
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	After discontinuation of <e1>flurazepam</e1> and pregabalin, a course of right unilateral ultrabrief ECT was associated with adequate seizures and remission of depression and <e2>suicidal ideation</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Depression and <e1>suicidal attempts</e1> have been reported with varenicline use but it is probably not induced by <e2>varenicline</e2> but by the quitting process per se.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Although debated, several reports have linked <e1>varenicline</e1> therapy to an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and/or <e2>suicide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	However, some serious side effects of <e1>varenicline</e1> have been reported, including depression, suicidal thoughts, and <e2>suicide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Although varenicline has previously been associated with <e1>suicidality</e1> and depression, side effects were low in this study and declined over time in the <e2>varenicline</e2> treatment group.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Two cases of <e1>attempted suicide</e1> were reported during treatment with <e2>varenicline</e2> (one patient took an overdose of a benzodiazepine with alcohol, the other slashed their wrist).
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Although a twofold increased risk of self harm with <e1>varenicline</e1> cannot be ruled out, these findings provide some reassurance concerning its association with <e2>suicidal behaviour</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Drugs targeting the cannabinoid system (rimonabant and <e1>taranabant</e1>) were consistently associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression, including reports of <e2>suicidal ideation</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	However, among three trials that were excluded from the analysis because of their open-label design, two cases of suicidal ideation and one <e1>completed suicide</e1> were reported in patients who had been treated with <e2>varenicline</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Since 2008, two of the medications (<e1>varenicline</e1> and bupropion) have come under increasing scrutiny because of reports of unexplained serious adverse events (SAEs), including behaviour change, depression, self-injurious thoughts and <e2>suicidal behaviour</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Upper abdominal pain, a possible drug interaction between pregabalin and <e1>blood glucose-lowering agents</e1>, and <e2>suicidal ideation</e2> were considered to be signals.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	People in Taiwan with <e1>methamphetamine</e1> use disorder appear to have a significantly increased all-cause mortality rate compared with the general population, with suicide having the highest contribution, particularly <e2>suicide</e2> via drug overdose.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	This report presents a case of a probable <e1>zolpidem</e1> induced <e2>suicide attempt</e2> and highlights similar studies of suicidal thoughts and behaviors of other patients that have taken the drug.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	<e1>Fluoxetine</e1> and sertraline gave EB05 scores for <e2>suicidality</e2> >2.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	In this data set, adolescent <e1>methamphetamine</e1> exposures were associated with increased rates of <e2>suicidal ideation</e2> and suicide attempts that are disproportionate to population-based surveys during the same period.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	She developed <e1>suicidal ideation</e1> and depression, which resolved after switching of <e2>levetiracetam</e2> to valproic acid, at the 1-month follow-up.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Suicide ideation and <e1>suicide attempts</e1> were strongly associated with occasional and regular smoking and <e2>nicotine</e2> dependence at baseline (Odds ratios [OR] range from 1.4 to 16.4).
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	<e1>Nicotine</e1> dependence cessation was associated with a decreased likelihood of <e2>suicide attempt</e2> compared with people currently dependent on nicotine (AOR 0.15; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.43).
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Recently, the FDA issued a warning raising concerns about the <e1>suicidality potential</e1> of <e2>montelukast</e2> and other leukotriene (LT) antagonists.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	The akathisia and <e1>suicidal thinking</e1> abated upon the discontinuation of the <e2>fluoxetine</e2> or the addition of propranolol.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Gradual increments of <e1>fluoxetine</e1> dose and the prompt recognition and treatment of akathisia may reduce further the rare occurrence of <e2>suicidal ideation</e2> during fluoxetine treatment.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who experience seizures weekly or more frequently, experience a lack of aura, use <e1>levetiracetam</e1>, or take antidepressants are all at a higher risk of <e2>suicide</e2> and should be monitored closely.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Multivariate analysis revealed that a high seizure frequency (odds ratio [OR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-10.2), a lack of aura before seizure (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.7-9.3), temporal lobe epilepsy (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.6-8.6), and use of <e1>levetiracetam</e1> (OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.1-53.7) and antidepressants (OR 7.2, 95% CI 1.5-34.1) were all associated with a higher probability of <e2>suicide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	While the FDA safety alerts apply to all three LTMAs, <e1>montelukast (known by its trade name Singulair®)</e1> is by far the most widely used of these drugs and most of the reports to date regarding <e2>suicide</e2> pertain to montelukast.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Despite the availability of CHC treatment, specifically interferon-α and <e1>ribavirin</e1>, treatment of CHC is limited by concerns about psychiatric side effects including risks of <e2>suicide</e2>.

DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	<e1>IFN beta-1a</e1> was temporarily withdrawn and treatment with citalopram, which the patient had spontaneously discontinued before the <e2>suicide attempt</e2>, was resumed.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	In this pharmacovigilance case-noncase study, significant RORs of <e1>suicidality</e1> and psychological adverse events were associated with <e2>finasteride</e2> use in patients younger than 45 years who used finasteride for alopecia.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	In 2003, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) advised against treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) other than <e1>fluoxetine</e1> in children, due to a possible increased risk of <e2>suicidal behaviour</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Risks for all-cause mortality, self-harm and <e1>suicide</e1>, and stroke in older patients may be higher among patients treated with quetiapine and <e2>antidepressant</e2> combination therapy.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Our findings therefore support educating patients and providers about possible <e1>suicide</e1>-related risks of discontinuing lithium even shortly after treatment initiation, and the close monitoring of patients after <e2>lithium</e2> discontinuation, if feasible.

DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Antiepileptic Drugs (AEDs) such as lamotrigine, gabapentin, and <e1>oxcarbazepine</e1> may have the potential to increase the risk of self-harm or <e2>suicidal behavior</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Having discontinued lithium therapy was associated with <e1>suicide</e1> also in the subgroup of patients for whom lithium had not completely prevented episodes during <e2>lithium</e2> treatment.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Many studies demonstrated an increased risk of depression, <e1>attempted suicide</e1> and suicide following <e2>isotretinoin</e2> treatment.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Since major depression, a common disorder associated with multiple health risks including <e1>suicide attempts</e1> and treatment noncompliance, may occur during the course of treatment with isotretinoin, persons treated with <e2>isotretinoin</e2> must be screened for depression before starting treatment and monitored for depression regularly during the course of treatment with isotretinoin.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Secondary measures include weekly assessment of methamphetamine craving, severity of <e1>methamphetamine</e1> dependence, methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms and psychiatric symptoms (depression, <e2>suicidality</e2>, psychotic symptoms and hostility).

DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Depressed mood and <e1>suicidality</e1> reported with 5α-reductase inhibitors (<e2>finasteride</e2> and dutasteride) during post-marketing surveillance resulted in the addition of depression risk to finasteride labeling.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Findings not so readily anticipated for trazodone, however, include higher relative frequencies for muscle weakness or soreness, skin swelling, and urinary complaints compared with <e1>fluoxetine</e1>; for fluoxetine, data are presented indicating a higher incidence of various psychologic/psychiatric adverse clinical events, including delusions and hallucinations, aggression, and <e2>suicidal ideation</e2>.

DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Specifically, in the case of <e1>levetiracetam</e1>, it is important to be aware of the subgroup of individuals with prior severe psychiatric illness, a history of traumatic brain injury, or a history of substance use disorder who might be at an increased risk of developing suicide-related behavior and <e2>suicidal ideations</e2> once levetiracetam is started.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	Rimonabant, a cannabinoid-1 receptor antagonist, was withdrawn from the market because of concerns about its safety, including risk of <e1>suicidal</e1> and seizures, although very effective in promoting clinically meaningful weight loss, reduction in waist circumference, and improvements in several metabolic risk factors, <e2>rimonabant</e2>, a cannabinoid-1 receptor antagonist was withdrawn from the market because it concerns about its safety, including risk of suicidal and seizures.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	The risk of suicide was significantly increased on (standard mortality ratio [SMR] = 6.1) as well as off lithium (SMR = 29.0), but the relative risk of <e1>suicide</e1> was 4.8 times higher during periods off <e2>lithium</e2> (p < .02; 95% confidence limits 1.1 to 12.6).
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	One additional patient committed suicide during the fourth month of isotretinoin treatment and 3 further patients attempted <e1>suicide</e1> by taking an overdose of <e2>isotretinoin</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	phencyclidine, <e1>ketamine</e1>, benzodiazepines, barbiturates) also suppress neuronal activity and drive developing neurons to commit <e2>suicide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	This study suggests that clonazepam, <e1>valproate</e1>, lamotrigine and phenobarbital relatively shortly after treatment initiation may increase the risk of <e2>suicide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	In the prospective analyses, prior occasional, regular smoking and <e1>nicotine</e1> dependence increased the risk for new onset of <e2>suicide ideation</e2> (OR range from 1.5 to 2.7) and prior regular smoking and nicotine dependence increased also the risk for onset of suicide attempt(s) (OR range between 3.1 and 4.5).
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	There were no deaths; 4 subjects had 5 serious adverse events (<e1>suicide attempt</e1>, hemolytic anemia and syncope, suicidal ideation, spontaneous abortion) unrelated to <e2>sumatriptan</e2>/naproxen sodium and resolved without sequelae.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	The primary results of this study were based on comparisons of several AEDs to topiramate as a reference drug for any indication (including epilepsy), and identified gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, <e1>tiagabine</e1>, and valproate as increasing risk of <e2>suicidality</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	These include studies which: (a) suggest that electroconvulsive therapy may be more effective than antidepressant drugs in reducing the frequency of suicide attempts; (b) indicate that antidepressants may differ in their capacity to reduce the frequency of <e1>suicide</e1> attempts; (c) find that more overdose attempts were made by patients receiving <e2>maprotiline</e2> than placebo; and (d) suggest that fluoxetine may be associated with a greater risk of inducing de novo suicidal ideation.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Age <35 years and central nervous system (CNS) stimulants including amphetamines and cocaine showed higher relative risks for accidental death and homicide, whereas CNS depressants including benzodiazepines, <e1>carisoprodol</e1>, opioids, and zolpidem were more strongly associated with accidental death and/or <e2>suicide</e2>.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	From marketing of <e1>isotretinoin</e1> in 1982 to May 2000, the FDA received reports of 37 US patients treated with isotretinoin who committed <e2>suicide</e2>; 110 who were hospitalized for depression, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempt; and 284 with nonhospitalized depression, for a total of 431 patients.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	Subjects who received <e1>zolpidem</e1> medication had a significantly higher risk of <e2>suicide</e2> after at least 80 months of observation, suggesting a long-term increased suicide risk associated with insomnia exposed to zolpidem medication.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	He was treated continuously with corticosteroids in combination with different immunosuppressive therapies (cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, interferon, infliximab, <e1>mycophenolate</e1>), which exerted numerous side-effects such as nephrotoxicity, nephrolithiasis, increase of liver enzymes, severe depression with <e2>suicidal ideation</e2>, severe leucopenia, pulmonary tuberculosis, pulmonary legionellosis, recurrent bronchopneumonia.
DRUG-ADE(e1,e2)	After adjustment for potential confounders such as the comorbidities of schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, insomnia, substance use, and other mental disorders, the Charlson comorbidity index, and use of <e1>benzodiazepine</e1> or antidepressants, zolpidem exposure was found to be significantly associated with the risk of <e2>suicide</e2>/suicide attempt with an OR of 2.08 (95% CIs, 1.83-2.36).
DRUG-ADE(e2,e1)	All FAERS reports of <e1>suicidality</e1> (including suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and completed suicide or a composite of these) in patients taking efavirenz (as single agent or in fixed-dose combination), atazanavir, darunavir, <e2>etravirine</e2>, nevirapine and raltegravir were identified.
